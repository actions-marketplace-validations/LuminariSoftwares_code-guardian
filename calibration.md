# Calibration

code-guardian 0.2.0 scanned at pinned commits of five well-known, clean Python projects and the four
LuminariSoftwares guardian repositories. The rule: every Safe FAIL on a clean repo is fixed in the check or justified
here. After the fixes listed below there are **no FAIL findings on any of the nine repositories**; every WARN is
listed with its verdict.

Reproduce with `python tools/calibrate.py` (it fetches each repository at the pinned commit and scans it offline).
Scores are offline (no `--online`), so they are reproducible.

## What calibration changed

The first run graded requests F, flask F, httpx D and click D, with Safe FAILs in requests, httpx and flask. Each pattern below
was reproduced in a small test (`tests/test_calibration.py`, red before the fix, green after) and fixed in the check:

| pattern seen | where | fix |
|---|---|---|
| Test credentials, test certificates, `verify=False` and pickle in tests counted as Safe FAIL/WARN | requests, httpx, flask | Safe findings in test code and documentation are reported at INFO, except API-key shapes and exec of decoded data, which stay as they are |
| `password="secret"` in documentation samples | httpx docs | same rule (documentation); a value that only names its field (`secret`, `password`) is a placeholder |
| TLS switched off only when the caller passes `verify=False` | httpx `_config.py` | `tls.off` is WARN when it sits under an `if` on a function parameter; FAIL only when hard-coded |
| The RFC 3986 alphabet read as a high-entropy secret | requests `utils.py` | a literal whose characters are all distinct is an alphabet, not a token |
| `if has_simplejson: from simplejson import ...` | requests `compat.py` | a flag set inside an import-guarded `try` guards imports too |
| Example sub-projects' `[project.scripts]` resolved from the repo root | click `examples/*/pyproject.toml` (10 FAILs) | scripts resolve next to the manifest that declares them |
| Imports of modules a test writes at runtime, docs-build imports | flask, click, httpx tests and docs | `works.import_unresolved` checks product code only (not tests, not `docs/`) |
| `.env.example` asked of every library that reads `NO_COLOR` | all nine repos | `complete.env_example` applies to applications only (the lockfile rule's markers) |
| `@pytest.fixture def test_apps()` counted as a test | flask `conftest.py` | fixture-decorated functions are not tests |
| XML namespace `http://www.w3.org/2000/svg` counted as egress | rich | namespace hosts are INFO |
| Public library API reported as dead code | requests, httpx, click, flask | for a library, the public API and its re-exports count as entry points |
| `from ._client import *`, `try: import / except: def`, a property getter and setter, module `__getattr__`, `@app.post` handlers | httpx, click, flask, context-guardian | star re-exports and both bindings are followed; same-name defs are merged; module dunders and registered handlers are reached with their module |

## Re-run: provider key shapes and tainted eval/exec

Added after the first calibration: AWS, Stripe, Slack and Hugging Face key shapes, the AWS secret-key rule,
high-entropy `*_KEY` / `*_TOKEN` literals, and `exec.dynamic` FAIL when `eval` or `exec` runs input. The re-run
scanned the same commits. The score table above did not change, and every finding at every level (1,752 across the
eight external repos) is identical before and after. Nothing new is reported, not even at INFO. code-guardian's own
scan stays at 100.

One pattern was caught on the way and fixed before the re-run (`tests/test_safe_gaps.py`, red before the fix, green
after):

| pattern seen | where | fix |
|---|---|---|
| `eval(compile(f.read(), startup, "exec"))` where `startup` is `os.environ.get("PYTHONSTARTUP")` read as "runs code typed by the user" | flask `src/flask/cli.py:1022` (Safe 80 → 50, grade B → D) | only the code text is checked for taint: `compile()`'s filename argument is not code. The line stays WARN |

## Re-run for 0.3: AI leftovers and privacy

0.3.0 adds `works.todo_stub` (WARN 3), `works.commented_code` (INFO), `works.dead_flag` (INFO), `privacy.pii_log`
(Safe WARN 5) and `privacy.pii_prompt` (Safe WARN 5). The scan status, locations, redaction, fingerprints and the
opt-in `--history` change no score: before these checks the table was byte-identical to 0.2.0, and all nine repos
scan COMPLETE.

**No new FAIL anywhere.** The first run added 14 `works.todo_stub` WARNs across requests, click, rich and flask.
Thirteen were deliberate no-ops and were fixed in the check (`tests/test_leftovers.py::
test_calibration_patterns_are_not_stubs`, red before the fix, green after); one is justified below. The privacy checks
and the two INFO checks report nothing on the nine repos, at any level: no personal-data name reaches a log, a print
or a prompt, no module-level boolean flag is unread, and none of the 163 comment runs of 5+ lines parses as code.

| pattern seen | where | fix |
|---|---|---|
| `class SupportsRead(Protocol[T]): def read(self) -> T: ...` | requests `_types.py` (2), flask `globals.py` | a `Protocol[T]` base is a Protocol |
| `def __exit__(self, *a): pass`, `def __enter__(self): pass` | click `utils.py`, flask `helpers.py` | dunder methods are protocol no-ops |
| `class NullFile: def flush(self): pass`, `class MockRequest: def add_header(...): raise NotImplementedError(...)` | rich `_null_file.py` (4), requests `cookies.py` | methods of null objects (`Null*`, `Noop*`, `Dummy*`, `Mock*`, `Fake*`) |
| `@click.group() def cli(): pass` | click `examples/` (3) | a `@group` callback does its work in its subcommands |

The score table above changed in one row: requests Works 92 → 89, Overall 92 → 91 (still A), from the one
justified WARN.

### Backup folders and test values (0.4.1)

Two changes in 0.4.1 move findings, so they are calibrated the same way: counts on a real project folder before and
after, no change on the fixtures, and no change on the five pinned repositories. The counts below were measured for P88 S5 with cg_review.py on the release candidate.

A real Windows scripts folder (the maintainer's own: 1,335 Python files and 4,877 other files, with an _archive/ of 1,203 backup copies and 48 *.backup-* files), scanned on 2026-10-24 (US Central) by 0.4.0 and by the 0.4.1 release candidate (main b466957) at the same moment:

| scan | secret.key FAIL | secret.key INFO (looks like a test value) | grade |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| 0.4.0, every file | 206 | 0 | F (19) |
| 0.4.1, every file (test values graded) | 107 | 99 | F (19) |
| 0.4.1, the two copies the page offered left out (--exclude '_archive/*' --exclude '*.backup-*') | 28 | 18 | F (19) |

The page offered exactly those two copies (151 and 9 findings) and held none back; the 160 findings they held are exactly the 160 the rescan no longer reports.
Each of the 99 "looks like a test value" reasons was checked against its line by a separate script that re-derives the reason without code-guardian (counts up, repeats one character, spells out a placeholder word): 99 of 99 true.
Every other (code, level) count is identical between 0.4.0 and 0.4.1 on this folder; only secret.key FAIL moved to INFO, and the per-file FAIL + INFO totals are unchanged.
The grade stays F because of two shell=True launchers (exec.shell FAIL) and 28 secret.key FAILs, most of them test values whose values look real; 13 of those carry the new hint (make the value say FAKE or TEST, or repeat one character).

Fixtures and pinned repositories:

| set | what changed | result |
|---|---|---|
| the 8 fixture repos (tests/fixtures, risky_repo as built by tests/make_risky.py) | scan report, sha256 of the canonical JSON | 0 delta against 0.4.0 (tests/test_p88_s4_acceptance.py), on Linux and Windows |
| the 5 pinned 0.2.0 repos (requests, click, rich, httpx, flask) and the three guardian repos, re-scanned with 0.4.1 (tools/calibrate.py commits) | every finding by node, code and level | 0 findings changed: no new FAIL and no FAIL moved to INFO |

### JavaScript / TypeScript calibration set (P81)

The create-vite template is React + TypeScript (`.tsx`); the create-next-app template is the TypeScript app-router app (JSX in `.tsx`, and `tsconfig.json` maps the `@/*` path alias), so the JSX rules run on real code. OWASP Juice Shop is deliberately vulnerable; it is read, never installed or run.

**Juice Shop `vuln-code-snippet` markers at `399fba76`: present.** 20 `vuln-code-snippet start` lines in 11 `.ts` files; 2 of those files only carry the marker text (the snippet parser `lib/codingChallenges.ts` and its unit test), so the real snippets are 16 start lines in 9 files, naming 25 challenges, with 27 `vuln-line` lines.

**Ground truth, list (a): marked `vuln-line`s.** In a category the JavaScript checks claim (2) -- the marker recall denominator; the sample is tiny, so it shows whether the Angular sanitizer bypass is caught, nothing more:

- `frontend/src/app/search-result/search-result.component.ts:146` -- localXssChallenge, xssBonusChallenge (XSS) -> `dom.html_sink`

### JavaScript / TypeScript results (P81 S4)

Scanned 2026-10-25 by the overseer with PR #52 (head `6ed24c3`) on the five pinned commits above: clones read only, nothing installed or run. "Files analysed" is what the walk hands to the JavaScript checks, with generated files counted apart. The Safe columns count findings in JavaScript / TypeScript files only.

| repo | files analysed | generated | files with an EOF error | Safe FAIL | Safe WARN | Safe INFO | generated: FAIL / WARN / INFO | WARNs per 1,000 lines | status / grade |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| express | 142 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 96 | 0 / 0 / 0 | 0.00 (22,046 lines) | COMPLETE / D |
| fastify | 282 | 16 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 705 | 0 / 0 / 0 | 0.01 (76,553 lines) | COMPLETE / B |
| create-vite react-ts | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 0 / 0 / 0 | 0.00 (139 lines) | COMPLETE / B |
| create-next-app app/ts | 4 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 0 / 0 / 0 | 0.00 (120 lines) | PARTIAL (the template folder has no package.json) / B |
| juice-shop | 373 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 42 | 379 | 0 / 0 / 0 | 1.26 (33,209 lines) | PARTIAL (2 Python test files do not parse) / F |

**No false Safe FAIL on express, fastify or the two templates.** The only FAIL among them is express `examples/auth/index.js:50` (`secret.key`): `hash({ password: 'foobar' }, ...)` in an example app. It is a hard-coded password literal, which is what the rule claims, and the secret scan (unchanged by P81) reported it before 0.5.0 too. fastify's eight `rejectUnauthorized: false` lines are all in `test/` files, and the existing test-code rule reports them at INFO. Juice Shop's FAIL, `lib/insecurity.ts:21`, is its deliberately committed private key.

**20 WARNs judged by hand.** This is a random sample (seed 81) of the 43 Safe WARNs in JavaScript / TypeScript files across the five repos. **False positives: 0.**

| 20 | juice-shop | `routes/fileUpload.ts:114` | exec.dynamic | true: runs a string as code (one of the planted RCE routes) |

**Juice Shop, two numbers, never summed.**
- **Lexer-loss: 0 of 7.** Every in-category grep hit in a file the scan analyses is found: `routes/captcha.ts:22`, `routes/b2bOrder.ts:23`, `routes/userProfile.ts:65`, `routes/fileUpload.ts:114`, `lib/xml.ts:12`, `lib/xml.ts:38` (`exec.dynamic` WARN) and `frontend/src/hacking-instructor/index.ts:126` (`dom.html_sink` WARN).
- **Marker recall: 0 of 2 at scan level, 2 of 2 when the files are lexed directly.** Both marked `vuln-line`s, `frontend/src/app/search-result/search-result.component.ts:113` and `:146`, are in `frontend/src/app/`. The walk leaves that folder out: the repo's `.gitignore` has `app/` and then `!frontend/src/app`, and code-guardian's `.gitignore` support ignores `!` negation (README, Limitations). Lexed directly (the S2 run), both are `dom.html_sink` WARN. With a sample of 2, this shows only whether the Angular sanitizer bypass is caught; it says nothing about recall in general.
- **The other 10 in-category grep hits are not scanned, for the same reason:** `frontend/src/assets/private/three.js:11375` (`!frontend/src/assets/`), `score-board.component.ts:83`, `administration.component.ts:74` and `:92`, `search-result.component.ts:113` and `:146`, `data-export.component.ts:58`, `track-result.component.ts:49`, `last-login-ip.component.ts:40` and `about.component.ts:120` (all under `frontend/src/app/`). This is a walk limit, not a lexer loss, and it is carried as a pickup item: honour `!` negation in `.gitignore` (or take the tracked-file list from git when a `.git` folder is present), so committed code that a negated pattern brings back is analysed.
