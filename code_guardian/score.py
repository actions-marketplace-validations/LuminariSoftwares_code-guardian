"""Three health scores (higher is better): Safe, Works and Complete, each 0-100, plus Overall and an A-F grade.

No model, no randomness, no clock: the same findings always give the same scores.

    deduction(weight, n) = weight + min(weight, ceil(weight * (n - 1) / 4))
        A check (one row of a table: code + level) deducts its weight once, plus a quarter of the weight for each
        extra occurrence, capped at twice the weight. Fifty copies of one minor issue cannot zero a score.
    dimension score      = max(0, 100 - sum of its deductions)      (Safe = 100 - the v0.1 threat score)
    Overall              = 0.5*Safe + 0.3*Works + 0.2*Complete, rounded half up; a dimension that is not scored
                           (Works when there is no Python source) is left out and the others' weights rescaled
    grade                = A >= 90, B >= 75, C >= 60, D >= 40, F below 40
    FAIL cap             = any Safe finding at FAIL caps the grade at D, whatever the average
    PARTIAL cap          = a PARTIAL scan caps the grade at B; an INVALID scan has no grade (None)
