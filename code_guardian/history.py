"""--history: the secret.key shape rules over every line git history added (opt-in).

A key that was committed and deleted later is still in the history, and anyone with a clone can read it; it may still
be valid. This runs one read-only command through subprocess with an argument list (never a shell):

    git --no-pager -C PATH -c core.fsmonitor=false -c log.showSignature=false
        log -p --no-color --no-ext-diff --no-textconv --relative --format=%H --max-count=DEPTH -- .

and reads its output up to a byte cap. It only reads: no checkout, no fetch, no config change, no lock (env
GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0). The -c overrides stop a scanned repo's own config from running a program (fsmonitor, GPG
signature checks); --no-ext-diff and --no-textconv do the same for diff drivers. Only added lines are checked, and only
key shapes (API-key prefixes, provider formats, AWS secret keys, private-key blocks): never the value, only the short
sha and the path, reaches a finding. A key still present in the current file is left to secret.key.

Public contract:
    DEPTH, BYTE_CAP, TIMEOUT
    command(root, depth) -> argv list
    scan(root, depth=DEPTH, byte_cap=BYTE_CAP, current=None) -> (findings, notes, skipped)
        # skipped: None when the history was read, else the reason (git missing, not a repository, git failed)
        # current: {relpath: text} of the working tree, to leave keys still there to secret.key
