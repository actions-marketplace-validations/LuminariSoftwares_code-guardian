"""Plain language over a scan report: the same numbers, in sentences a person who does not write code can read.

Every function here is a pure read of the report dict `report.scan()` (and `scan --json`) produces. Nothing in this
module scans, scores, re-ranks or edits anything: it never writes to the report and never computes a number of its
own. When a sentence carries a number, that number was already in the report.

What it will not say. A static scan sees patterns in files it could read. It cannot run the code, so it cannot
promise anything about what the code does. Every sentence below is therefore written as what the check *saw*, and
VERDICT_PHRASES lists the words that would turn that into a promise; no sentence this module produces contains one
of them, and the acceptance test greps for them over every fixture.
